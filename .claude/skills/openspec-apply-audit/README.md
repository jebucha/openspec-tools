# opsx-apply-audit

Apply audit findings and recommendations to an OpenSpec change's artifacts.

## Overview

`/opsx-apply-audit` is the remediation step in the OpenSpec workflow. After `/opsx-audit` identifies structural issues in a change's artifacts (proposal, design, specs, tasks), this command resolves them — creating missing specs, adding scenarios, fixing references, and ensuring artifacts are consistent and complete before implementation begins.

## Workflow Position

```
/opsx-propose  →  /opsx-audit  →  /opsx-apply-audit  →  /opsx-apply
   (create)        (review)         (fix artifacts)      (implement code)
```

| Step | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `/opsx-propose` | Generate change artifacts (proposal, design, specs, tasks) |
| 2 | `/opsx-audit` | Review artifacts for accuracy, completeness, and validity (read-only) |
| 3 | `/opsx-apply-audit` | Resolve errors and warnings found during audit |
| 4 | `/opsx-apply` | Implement the actual source code changes described in the artifacts |

## Usage

```
/opsx-apply-audit [change-name]
```

If the change name is omitted, the command will:
- Infer from conversation context
- Auto-select if only one active change exists
- Prompt for selection if ambiguous

## Prerequisites

- A change must exist with artifacts (run `/opsx-propose` first)
- An audit must have been run in the current session (run `/opsx-audit` first)
- If no audit report is found in context, the command will suggest running one

## What It Does

### 1. Locates the Audit Report

Finds the most recent `/opsx-audit` output from the current session and parses the findings by severity:
- **Errors** — must fix before implementation
- **Warnings** — should fix for quality
- **Info** — optional, applied if straightforward

### 2. Plans Remediation

For each finding, determines the appropriate fix:

| Finding Type | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Missing spec for listed capability | Creates spec file with requirements + scenarios |
| Contradictory specs | Resolves conflict aligned to proposal intent |
| Missing requirement scenarios | Adds Given/When/Then scenarios |
| Broken task dependencies | Fixes cross-references |
| Non-testable requirements | Rewrites with measurable criteria |
| Empty/placeholder sections | Populates from proposal/design context |
| Naming convention violations | Renames to kebab-case |
| Stale file references | Updates or removes invalid paths |

The full plan is presented to the user for confirmation before any changes are made.

### 3. Applies Fixes

Iterates through findings, making targeted changes to the affected artifact files:
- `openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/<name>/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/**/*.md`
- `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`

### 4. Re-validates

After fixes are applied, runs a quick consistency check:
- Capability names align between proposal and specs
- Task references are intact
- No new empty sections introduced
- New spec files follow conventions

### 5. Reports Results

Shows what was fixed, what remains, and suggests next steps.

## Behavior on Ambiguity

The command pauses and asks the user when:
- Multiple valid resolutions exist for a finding
- A fix would alter design intent
- Fixing one issue would create a new inconsistency

It will never guess at intent or silently change the goals of a change.

## Guardrails

- **Confirmation required** — Always presents the remediation plan before making changes
- **Intent preservation** — Fixes align artifacts to stated goals; never rewrites the goals
- **Minimal changes** — Each fix is scoped to its finding only
- **Style preservation** — Maintains existing artifact formatting and conventions
- **No scope expansion** — Only addresses audit findings; doesn't improve unrelated content
- **Post-fix validation** — Catches cascading issues introduced by fixes

## Iterative Use

The command can be run multiple times:

```
/opsx-audit        → finds 3 errors, 2 warnings
/opsx-apply-audit  → fixes errors, 1 warning ambiguous (paused)
                     user provides guidance
/opsx-apply-audit  → fixes remaining warning
/opsx-audit        → clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
/opsx-apply        → begin implementation
```

## Example Output

### Clean Run

```
## Audit Fixes Applied: add-data-export

**Schema:** spec-driven
**Findings resolved:** 3/3

### Fixed This Session
- ✓ [Error] Created missing spec: specs/pdf-export/spec.md
- ✓ [Error] Added 2 scenarios to "User can filter exports"
- ✓ [Warning] Populated "Goals / Non-Goals" section

### Remaining (not addressed)
- [Info] Task 3.2 has no direct spec requirement (implementation detail — no fix needed)

### Quick Validation
✓ Capability names consistent between proposal and specs
✓ Task references intact
✓ No new empty sections introduced

Artifacts are clean. Run `/opsx-apply` to start implementing.
```

### Paused (User Input Needed)

```
## Remediation Paused: add-user-auth

**Progress:** 2/3 findings fixed

### Ambiguous Finding
**[Error]** Contradictory specs: `user-auth/spec.md` says sessions expire in 30m,
`admin-panel/spec.md` says sessions expire in 8h.

**Options:**
1. Align both to 30m (stricter security posture)
2. Use 30m for users, 8h for admins (role-based differentiation)
3. Defer — what's the intended behavior?
