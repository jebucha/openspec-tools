Validate a change's implementation against its proposal, specs, design, and audit findings.

After `/opsx-apply` implements a change, this skill independently verifies that the implementation is correct, complete, and ready for archive. It examines the actual code changes against the spec requirements, checks test coverage, verifies task completion, and detects regressions.

---

**Output Constraints:**
- Cap findings at **50 total**. If more are detected, include the top 50 by severity (Errors first, then Warnings, then Info) and add an overflow summary line: "N additional findings omitted (X warnings, Y info)."
- Assign each finding a **stable ID** prefixed with `VD-` (Validation). Number sequentially: `VD-1`, `VD-2`, etc. Same input should produce same IDs on re-run.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Validating change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx-validate <other>`).

2. **Check change status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `artifacts`: Which artifacts exist and their status
   - `isComplete`: Whether all artifacts are created

   **If no artifacts exist:** Report that the change has no artifacts to validate. Suggest using `/opsx-propose` first.

3. **Read all change artifact files**

   Read every artifact file that exists for the change:
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md`
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/design.md`
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/**/*.md` (use glob to find all spec files)
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`

   Skip files that don't exist — note missing artifacts as Info findings.

4. **Determine the scope of code to validate**

   Identify which source files were modified or created by this change:
   - Scan the design.md and tasks.md for referenced file paths
   - Run `git diff --name-only` (or `git status --porcelain`) to find changed files
   - Cross-reference: files mentioned in tasks AND files actually changed
   - If no git changes exist (change not yet implemented), flag as Error and skip to step 9

   Read the changed source files to understand what was implemented.

5. **Run Spec Compliance Checks**

   For each spec requirement (from spec files):
   - Determine what behavior the requirement specifies
   - Search the changed code for evidence of that behavior
   - Classify each requirement as:
     - **Satisfied**: Code clearly implements the required behavior
     - **Partially satisfied**: Code addresses the requirement but with gaps (Warning)
     - **Not satisfied**: No evidence the requirement is implemented (Error)

   For each finding, include:
   - The requirement text
   - Evidence: file path, function/class name, or description of what's missing

   **Evidence-based:** Every finding must cite specific code (or absence thereof). Don't speculate.

6. **Run Test Coverage Checks**

   For each spec requirement:
   - Search for test files that test the new functionality
   - Look for test files in common locations: `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`
   - Check that tests cover:
     - Happy path (basic functionality)
     - Edge cases described in spec scenarios
   - Classify coverage as:
     - **Covered**: Tests exist and cover happy path + edge cases
     - **Partially covered**: Tests exist but miss edge cases (Warning)
     - **Not covered**: No tests found for the requirement (Error)

   For each finding, include:
   - The requirement text
   - Evidence: test file path, test names, or description of what's missing

7. **Run Task Completion Checks**

   Parse tasks.md for task status:
   - Count `- [x]` (complete) vs `- [ ]` (incomplete)
   - **If incomplete tasks exist:** Raise Error listing each incomplete task
   - **For each completed task:** Verify the expected code changes exist in the codebase
     - Cross-reference the task description with actual file changes
     - If a task is marked complete but no corresponding code changes exist, raise Error

   For each finding, include:
   - The task description
   - Evidence: task number, checkbox state, and whether code changes are present

8. **Run Code Quality Checks (best-effort)**

   For changed source files, check for obvious issues:
   - Unused imports
   - Dead code (commented-out blocks, unreachable code)
   - Obvious type mismatches or syntax errors
   - Inconsistent patterns with surrounding code

   These are Info-level findings — not blocking, but worth noting.

   **Scope:** Only check files touched by this change. Don't audit the entire codebase.

9. **Run Regression Safety Checks (best-effort)**

   For changed files, check:
   - Do modifications to existing functions preserve their public interface?
   - Are existing callers still compatible with the changes?
   - Were existing tests modified or removed?

   These are Warning-level findings — flag potential regressions without being alarmist.

   **Scope:** Only check files touched by this change and their immediate callers.

10. **Detect regressions from prior validations**

    Before producing the final report, check if any prior validations in `openspec/changes/<name>/validations/` have resolved findings.

    **10a. Parse resolved findings from prior validations**
    - Look in `openspec/changes/<name>/validations/` for validation files with a `## Resolved` header
    - From each, extract finding IDs listed under `### Resolved` (e.g., `- VD-3: ...`)
    - Build a set of resolved finding IDs mapped to their source validation filename

    **10b. Compare against new findings**
    - For each finding in the new validation, check if its ID (e.g., `VD-3`) appears in the resolved set
    - A match indicates a regression — the issue was fixed but reappeared

    **10c. Generate Regressions section**
    - If regressions are found, insert a `### Regressions` section between `### Findings` and `### Coverage Metrics`
    - Format as a table:

    ```
    ### Regressions

    | ID | Description | Source Validation |
    |----|-------------|-------------------|
    | VD-3 | Missing tests for X | `2026-07-15T10-30-model.md` — was resolved, reappeared |
    ```

    - Classify each regression as a **Warning** severity
    - Include regressions in the overall warning count
    - If no regressions, skip the section

    **10d. No prior validations**
    - If no validation files exist, skip regression detection

11. **Produce structured report**

    Display the validation results:

    ```
    ## Validation Report: <change-name>

    **Schema:** <schema-name>
    **Model:** <model that performed the validation>
    **Artifacts checked:** <list of artifacts that were read>

    ### Summary
    - Errors: <count>
    - Warnings: <count>
    - Info: <count>

    ---

    ### Findings

    | ID | Category | Severity | Description | Evidence |
    |----|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
    | VD-1 | Spec compliance | Error | Requirement "User can export" not implemented | No code at `src/export.ts` matching spec requirement |
    | VD-2 | Test coverage | Warning | Edge case not tested | `tests/export.test.ts` — missing invalid input scenario |
    | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

    ### Coverage Metrics

    | Metric | Value |
    |--------|-------|
    | Total requirements | <count> |
    | Requirements satisfied | <count> (<percent>%) |
    | Requirements with tests | <count> (<percent>%) |
    | Tasks complete | <count>/<total> (<percent>%) |
    | Changed files examined | <count> |

    ---

    ### Verdict
    ```

    **Verdict rules:**
    - 0 errors → **Pass**: "Implementation validated. Ready for archive."
    - 0 errors, ≥1 warning → **Conditional**: "Proceed with caution. Review warnings before archiving."
    - ≥1 error → **Fail**: "Cannot proceed. Resolve errors before archiving."

12. **Persist the validation report**

    Save the structured output to a file:

    ```
    openspec/changes/<name>/validations/<timestamp>-<model>.md
    ```

    - Create the `validations/` directory if it doesn't exist
    - Timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM` (e.g., `2026-07-15T10-30`)
    - Model: short identifier (e.g., `claude-opus`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-pro`)
    - Example: `openspec/changes/add-user-auth/validations/2026-07-15T10-30-claude-opus.md`

    Announce: "Validation saved to `<path>`"

    **12a. Auto-supersede older validation files**

    After writing the new validation, check for existing validation files in the same `validations/` directory. For each file whose timestamp in the filename is older than the new validation's timestamp:

    - Read the existing file
    - Prepend: `## Superseded: <new-filename> (<N> errors, <N> warnings)\n\n`
    - Parse `<N> errors, <N> warnings` from the new validation's `### Summary`
    - Write the file back with the supersede header at the very beginning
    - This preserves the lifecycle chain — headers stack, newest at top

    Announce: "Superseded N older validation file(s)" (only if any were superseded)

13. **Offer follow-up actions**

    After displaying the report, offer:
    - "Want me to help fix any of these findings?"
    - "Run `/opsx-validate` again with a different model to compare."
    - "Run `/opsx-archive` to archive (if Pass or Conditional verdict)."
    - "Run `/opsx-apply` to continue implementing (if Fail verdict)."

```

**Guardrails**

- **Read-only** — Never modify code during validation. Flag issues; don't fix them.
- **Evidence-based** — Every finding must include specific evidence (file path, line reference, quoted text)
- **Stable IDs** — Finding IDs must be deterministic. Same input should produce same IDs on re-run.
- **Capped output** — Maximum 50 findings. Prioritize by severity. Summarize overflow.
- **Scope to change** — Only examine files touched by the change and their immediate dependencies. Don't audit the entire codebase.
- **Don't be prescriptive** — Focus on structural issues and spec gaps. Use Info level for subjective observations.
- **Handle missing artifacts gracefully** — If an artifact doesn't exist, note it but continue validating what's available.
- **Code quality is best-effort** — Basic checks only. Don't replace linters or type checkers.
- **Regression safety is best-effort** — Check public interfaces and callers. Don't perform exhaustive impact analysis.
- **Test checks are structural** — Verify tests exist and cover scenarios. Don't run tests or judge test quality beyond coverage.
- **Backward compatible** — Validation files without lifecycle headers function normally. Supersede logic gracefully handles legacy files.
- **Header parsing is position-sensitive** — Only parse `## Resolved` and `## Superseded` headers at the very start of the file.
- **Supersede is timestamp-based** — Compare timestamps in filenames to determine ordering. Only supersede strictly older files.

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime** after implementation has begun
- **Pairs with `/opsx-apply`**: implement changes, then validate
- **Iterative**: Can be run multiple times as implementation progresses
- **Gates `/opsx-archive`**: Advises whether change is ready for archive
- **Non-destructive**: Read-only analysis — never modifies code or artifacts
